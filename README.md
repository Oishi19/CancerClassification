This project presents an in-depth analysis of digital image operation. The proposed project leverages state-of-the-art technologies to provide a wide range of features, including anime-style rendering, interactive colourization, portrait mode, grey scale background generation, super-resolution, white balance correction, Instagram filters, and Bezier curves for selective editing. The tool is built with a focus on user interaction, allowing users to manipulate images in real-time and see the results instantly. This report discusses the design and implementation of the project, the technologies used, and the challenges faced during development. The goal is to help other researchers understand and apply these open-source computer vision and deep learning solutions for enhancing digital photos.
